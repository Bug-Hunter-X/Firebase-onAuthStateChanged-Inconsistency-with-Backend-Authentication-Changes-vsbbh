The Firebase SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not trigger if the user's authentication state changes due to a backend operation, such as a custom token refresh or a server-side sign-out. This can lead to the app remaining in an outdated authentication state, causing unexpected behavior.  For example, a user might still appear logged in even though their session has expired on the server.
