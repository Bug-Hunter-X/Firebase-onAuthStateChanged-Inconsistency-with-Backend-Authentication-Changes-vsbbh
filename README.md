# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener where it fails to immediately reflect authentication changes initiated from the backend.  This can lead to inconsistencies in the application's state and potentially security vulnerabilities.

The `firebaseBug.js` file showcases the problematic behavior. The `firebaseBugSolution.js` file provides a solution using a combination of `onAuthStateChanged` and explicit calls to check the authentication state periodically using `currentUser` to ensure state consistency.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Firebase and required dependencies. 
3. Set up your Firebase project and configuration.
4. Run `firebaseBug.js` and observe the behavior.
5. Run `firebaseBugSolution.js` to see the improved solution.

## Solution

The provided solution involves explicitly checking for changes to `auth.currentUser` periodically.  While this introduces slightly more complexity, it guarantees that your application's authentication status aligns with the server-side state.  It's also crucial to handle possible errors appropriately.
